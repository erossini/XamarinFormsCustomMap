Map Custom Renderer
===================

This sample demonstrates how to create a custom renderer for the `Map` control, which displays a native map with a customized pin and a customized view of the pin data on each platform.

For more information about this sample see
- [Custom render Map](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/application-fundamentals/custom-renderer/map/)
- [Customizing a Map Pin](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/custom-renderer/map/customized-pin/).

I'm changing the original code to merge those projects. The result is in the following image. My improvements are:
- multiple pins
- generate dynamically a pin based on the first letter of the Pid.Id
- show the route
